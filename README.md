# Exploring Grokking Algorithms With Rust
Working through examples from the book Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava. This repo is largley to explore Rust a little more.

The following algorithms have been implemented using Rust as examples of topics inspired by the book.
  - Chapter 1
    + Binary Search
  - Chapter 2
    + Linked List
    + Selection Sort
  - Chatper 3
    + Recursion
  - Chapter 4
    + Quicksort
  - Chapter 5
    + Hashtable

### Trying yourself...
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate rust binary. The code all was built using rust 1.46.0. To try any of the algorithms clone the repo, then `cd` into the one of the chapter algorithm folders then run `cargo run` to see an example of the algorithm being used.
